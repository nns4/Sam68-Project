# Sam68-Project aim 
The literature evidence discussed above suggest that Sam68 is a multifunctional protein, that plays roles in alternative splicing, RNA stability, cell proliferation, and survival. However, molecular targets of Sam68 that allows it to exact these biological functions remains largely unknown. Further, the main role of Sam68 mRNA targeting and its functional impact is not well established. Thus, this project aims to identify the molecular targets of Sam68 using integrative analysis of publicly available genomic datasets relevant to Sam68 activity and function. Integrating results from various experiments is essential in establishing cognate Sam68â€™s mRNA targets and characterisation of its physiological functions. 
To achieve the aim of this project, specific objectives were investigated such as:
1).Implementing an automated literature search framework using R to retrieve relevant datasets. 
2).Comparison of mRNA profiles of Sam68 siRNA treated cells with control cells using negative binomial model (Limma method). 
3). Comparison of expression profiles of mRNA bound to Sam68 in spliceosome with whole cell RNA using Gaussian distribution.
4). Identification of Sam68 co-expressed genes in tissues samples using correlation analysis.
5). Perform target identification by integrating results of objective 2-4, using both estimates of central tendency and hypergeometric statistics.
6). Identify known and novel biological processes regulated by Sam68 from objective 5.
